# Audio-files-and-lexical-statistics-for-Danish-words-and-nonwords

This repository includes audio files and spreadsheets with lexical statistics for a set of Danish words and nonwords that may be used for lexical decision or other psycholinguistic tasks.

Information about the words, nonwords and extraction of lexical statistics may be found in L.W. Balling _Morphological Effects in Danish Auditory Word Recognition_. PhD-dissertation, Aarhus University, 2008. The thesis is available in the repository as Balling_phd_final.pdf.

Results of experiments using these and derived stimuli are reported by:
- LW Balling, RH Baayen. 2008. Morphological effects in auditory word recognition: Evidence from Danish. _Language and Cognitive Processes_ 23 (7-8), 1159-1190. (exp2_words and exp2_nonwords)
- LW Balling, RH Baayen. 2012. Probability and surprisal in auditory comprehension of morphologically complex words. _Cognition_ 125(1), 80-106. (exp1_words, exp1_nonwords, exp3_words, exp3_nonwords)
